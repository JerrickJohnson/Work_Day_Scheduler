# Work Day Scheduler

## Description:
Work Day Scheduler application is a used as a daily planner for a business day of 9 am to 5 pm. When
opened it will display the current day at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down the user is 
presented with time blocks for standard business hours 9am to 5pm. Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate if
it is in the past, present, or future. When the time block is a past time it will appear gray, when the time block 
is the present hour it will appear red, and when the time block is in the future it will appear green. The user can 
then enter an event or task and hit the save button on the right side of each time block. This will then save the 
users task or event so they will be able to see it whent the application is refreshed.
